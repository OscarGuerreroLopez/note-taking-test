# Note taking code test

Create a simple note-taking web application. A user should be able to:

- Add a note
- Edit a note
- Delete a note

Also:

- Each note should be in a colored rectangular box.
- Box colors can be selected from a fixed list of colors.

We want you to use React to complete the app. You can use any code scaffolding tool such as [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or similar to concentrate on the code. Be free to use plain Javascript or any variant such as Typescript, or any code testing framework.

We would value a lot if you add some tests to the solution. Don't aim for full coverage as it would take you a lot of extra time, adding a couple of simple cases would be fine.

We won't be evaluating the appearance or the visual design so feel free to use unstyled HTML for the solution.

Completing the test should take you **2 hours or less**.

Once the test is completed, please add a note on this README with instructions to run the application and the tests. Assume the reviewer will know the tools so you don't have to explain how to install Npm or Yarn, just naming the needed commands would be fine.

ZIP the final code and return it so it can be evaluated.

Thanks for your time!

# How to run the application

```bash

$ yarn

$ yarn start

```

# How to run the application tests

Not yet completed, at the end the test was done in 4 hours and I did not have time to add test, wanted to present something right away before it was too late. But maybe I over did it and thus I ran out of time

```bash

$ yarn test

```
